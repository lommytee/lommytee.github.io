    <h1>What I Do</h1>

    <p>
    I direct, write, edit and produce stories. I strive to make high-concept
    entertainment that is surreal, fun, and reminds us we determine our own mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
    I interned at Prettybird (London, UK) to learn from music video professionals,
    the Oldenburg International Film Festival (Germany) to discover how great 
    independent films get exhibited, and had a screenwriting masterclass 
    doing reader’s reports for Brightlight Pictures (Vancouver, Canada).
    In 2017, I graduated from Capilano University’s Bachelor of Motion Picture Arts Program 
    with the Dean’s Award of Excellence.  
    </p>

    <p>
    In the next three to five years I intend to write and direct my first 
    feature film. Presently, I’m eager to direct commercials, music videos and
    short films. 
    </p>

    <p>
    If you like my work, I’d love to talk!
